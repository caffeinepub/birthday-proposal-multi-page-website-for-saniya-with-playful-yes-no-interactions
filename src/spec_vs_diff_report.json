  "summary": "Most core flow is implemented: 4 TanStack Router routes with Page1→Page2→Page3→Page4 navigation, Page1 “No” cycling behavior, celebration/kiss overlays, auto-advance from Page3 to Page4, and a cohesive baby-pink romantic layout. However, several acceptance-criteria details appear unmet (exact button labels / exact final line), and the required generated image files themselves are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Some unrequested Internet Identity/actor scaffolding and a backend actor stub were introduced.",
